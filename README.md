# Example Redis server Vagrant box

_Based upon information from https://github.com/mdevilliers/vagrant-redis._

This sets up a Redis server.

**The server is NOT production ready. Mainly as it's configured for development (i.e. NO security).**

As a minimum, turn on the protected mode in configuration prior to running for any non-dev reason.
